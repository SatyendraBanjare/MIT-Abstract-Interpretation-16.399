# MIT-Abstract-Interpretation-16.399

Exploring abstract interpretation!!

This repository contains the supplied proect files and lectures in the course and my personal made notes that can be found in `\notes` directory. This also contains a small abstract interpretor that I made which can be found in the `/abstract_interpretor` directory.

To generate notes, run make command in the notes directory.
